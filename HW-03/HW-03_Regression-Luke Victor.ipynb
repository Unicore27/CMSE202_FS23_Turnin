    "&#9989;  **Question 3.5 (6 points)**: Assuming you did everything correctly, the relationship between a penguin's body mass and it's bill depth is the opposite when you split the data by species. This might seem confusing to you. Part of the reason for this is because we skipped a very important step regarding dealing with unfamiliar data, that is **visualizing the data**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Do this**: Make a scatterplot showing the penguins' body mass vs. bill depth. Color code the dots so that each species gets a different color. Then, display the best fit line for each of the three species using the same color and display the best fit line for all the penguins using a different color. Don't forget to label your axes. When you're done, you should have a plot that contains three different colors of dots and 4 different lines (3 of the lines should match the colors of the three penguin species, respectively)\n",

    "**Hint**: We've included a function to help you plot a line. Feel free to use it, or not. "
